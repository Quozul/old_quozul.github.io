You may be unknowingly, I also made some other small projects before tackling the development of Pirikium, here is a list of them:

### [Destructive-Dot](https://github.com/Quozul/destructive-dot)
<p class="post-meta">March 30, 2018</p>
The goal of the game is to destruct the maximum of blocks without getting out of range, if you do, well, you loose (what a looser you are).
[Fast download](https://github.com/Quozul/destructive-dot/releases/latest).

### [Brick-Breaker](https://github.com/Quozul/brick-breaker)
<p class="post-meta">January 12, 2018</p>
Well, don't be silly, it's all in the game. If you never played a brick-breaker, I blame you.
[Fast download](https://github.com/Quozul/brick-breaker/releases/latest).

### [Fuald](https://github.com/Quozul/fuald)
<p class="post-meta">January 1, 2018</p>
This was my first game, a text-based one which can only works on Linux<sup>[*](https://github.com/Quozul/fuald/wiki)</sup>. There is no real goal, however you can kill creatures, tame others and level up.

The original version of Fuald, which was created in August 2017, was only in French and really bad coded but it's still accessible [over there](https://github.com/quozul/fuald/tree/Eur%C3%A9lis-v0).

### [This website](https://github.com/Quozul/quozul.github.io)
And of course, this website is one of my projects. It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the current theme is based on the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) made by the Jekyll team.

The older version is also available [here](https://github.com/Quozul/quozul.github.io/releases/tag/v0.8d). This one was made from scratch only in HTML and CSS.
