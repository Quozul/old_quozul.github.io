The new website has just been released, the new version is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Let's take a tour!  
The usage of Jekyll on the website let us write posts to get you up-to-date.

### Front page

At first, you'll see the title of the latest post and an excerpt of it.

If you scroll down a bit, you'll start to see all the posts and some usefull link, curently there is only one post which is this one üòÅ.

### A post
There're nothing really special on this page, however you can see who written the post and the date.  
(Uw, making a screenshot of someting I'm writing is quite a pain...)

### Other projects
This page lists the other projects I made, you should visit it, it's [right there](/other-projects), go for it!

### About page
Finally, there is the page named __About__ where I don't really know what to write so curently, there's not a lot to read üòÖ.

You can access both __About__ and __Other projects__ page with the menu at the top.

#### Phones
And of course, the website works on phones!  
(Yes that's an iPod but it works like a phone...)
